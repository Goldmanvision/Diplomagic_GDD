# Summary

## What changed
- Departments established and codenames recorded; chat naming standardized.
- Project-wide Canvas Audit + Chat Alignment notice issued.
- Authenticity & Research seeded: refs (5 primary sources), period term checks (3 batches), glossary (3 batches).
- Narrative mirrors created for Playbook and Outline with source metadata, bytes, MD5, page counts.
- Steam Operations charter and dashboard stubs created.
- Adversary & NPC Systems: dashboard, schema, 4 statblocks, and Prologue+Ch1 spawn tables; two legacy docs archived with stubs.
- QA & UX dashboard created.
- ASCII-safe rollout executed: duplicates generated, mapping, plan and scripts provided; renames applied; link-fix pass committed; tracked scan clean outside Archive/Backups.

## Current state (.md deliverables)
- research/refs/refs_seed_1994.md — 5 sources
- research/checks/period_check_core_terms_1994.md — batches 1–3
- research/glossary_1994.md — batches 1–3
- narrative/playbook.md; narrative/outline_2025.md — mirrors
- ops/steam/steam_ops_charter_20250817.md; ops/steam/steam_ops_dashboard_20250817.md
- departments/adversary-npc-systems/adversary-npc-systems-dashboard.md (ASCII-safe target)
- data/statblocks/schema_statblock.md; enemy_* statblocks (4 files)
- data/spawn/spawn_tables_prologue_ch1.md
- departments/qa-ux/qa-ux-dashboard.md (ASCII-safe target)
- ops/maintenance/ascii-safe-mapping-20250817.md; repo-rename-plan-20250817.md; scripts/apply-ascii-safe-renames.(sh|ps1)

## Risks / notes
- Archive/Backups contain legacy names; excluded from link-fix by policy.
- Windows path length and encoding issues mitigated by ASCII-safe move.
- Period accuracy enforced via checks/glossary; continue citing in A&R.

## Next 48h focus
1) QA & UX: seed /departments/qa-ux/templates/ (bug_report, playtest_survey, severity_matrix).
2) Steam Ops: depot/branch map draft; store asset checklist.
3) A&R: add citations for the five seed refs; attach scans/links in refs file.
4) Narrative: confirm Chapter 1 encounter pacing aligns with spawn tables.
