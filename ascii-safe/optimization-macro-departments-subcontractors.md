# Macro: `ptopt` — UI/Canvas Optimization Request
Use to streamline a single department or subcontractor workspace. Paste as-is and replace `<>`.

```
From: Postmaster (Mail Department)
To: <Department or Contractor>
Subj: Optimize canvases and focus — <Department>

Action required
1) Mirror all active docs with the standard header and confirm repo paths.  
2) Create `<Department> — Dashboard.md` listing **Keep** (active) and **Archive candidates**.  
3) Propose archiving duplicate/superseded canvases; prepare stubs.  
4) Collapse or mute non‑<Department> chats manually (cannot automate); confirm done.  
5) Confirm latest Corkboard notice (`/Corkboard/latest.md`) used.  
6) Reply with the summary format below.

Constraints
- Scope: your department only. Exports: `.md` only.  
- Enforce 1994/1989 period accuracy.  
- No background work claims. Deliver in this chat.  
- If you lack repo access, attach `.md` files; Postmaster will commit.
