# DECISIONS
## 2025-08-17
- Adopt Gate Map (G1–G6) per Suit for all deliverables.
- Clarify SG-20250817: Spectral Exposure math; **no** spectral-full in Prologue; Ch1 cap = 1; Ch6 cap = 2; Ch3 Reddy tutorial exempt.
- Correct Prologue spawns: convert PRO-02 basement full → flicker; keep chapter caps.
- Narrative report to include SE tallies, seeds→payoffs, branch coverage, failstates, UI strings/controls, links to Playbook/Outline.
- Taxonomist to maintain spawn↔scene bindings notes with cap tracking.
