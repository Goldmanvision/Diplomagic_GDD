## 2025-08-17 â€” Decision
Context:
Adopt a standardized macro pack to accelerate inter-department communication and enforce consistent exports and formats.

Options:
1) Adopt Macro Pack v0.1 now.
2) Defer for wider review.
3) Reject and proceed ad hoc.

Decision:
Adopt Macro Pack v0.1.

Rationale:
- Reduces typing and inconsistency across departments.
- Aligns with 1994/1989 constraints and export rules.
- Low implementation cost.

Impact:
- New macros available workspace-wide.
- Single source of truth at docs/macros.md.
- Requires periodic refresh if chat resets.

Owner:
Macro Manager (subcontractor for Goldmanvision)
