# DECISIONS

## 2025-08-17 — Retire automated 
- “new-commits + handoff validation” task. 

- **Rationale: unstable auth, UI resets, inconsistent local envs.
- Validation now on-demand by Mail.


## 2025-08-17
- Adopt Gate Map (G1–G6) per Suit for all deliverables.
- Clarify SG-20250817: Spectral Exposure math; **no** spectral-full in Prologue; Ch1 cap = 1; Ch6 cap = 2; Ch3 Reddy tutorial exempt.
- Correct Prologue spawns: convert PRO-02 basement full → flicker; keep chapter caps.
- Narrative report to include SE tallies, seeds→payoffs, branch coverage, failstates, UI strings/controls, links to Playbook/Outline.
- Taxonomist to maintain spawn↔scene bindings notes with cap tracking.
## 2025-08-17
- Archivist Batch D: citations added to `research/refs/refs_seed_1994.md`; `research/refs/scans/` established for artifacts.
- Policy: refs with `TBD` scans must attach or be waived before 08/24 freeze.
- Warning: Lovecraft PD varies by work; verify renewals per-title before inclusion.
