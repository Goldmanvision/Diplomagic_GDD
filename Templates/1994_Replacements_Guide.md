# 1994 Replacements Guide (root docs)

Replace modern terms with period-correct language.

- GPS  -> printed road atlas; paper map; posted signage; directions by phone
- Wi-Fi -> dial-up modem; leased line; no wireless LAN
- Bluetooth -> wired serial (RS-232); cabled headset; hardline connection
- Smartphone -> pager + landline; PDA (offline); mobile phone (voice only)
- SMS -> pager message; voicemail; phone call
Notes:
- Keep negatives intact (e.g., "No GPS" is valid).
- Prefer concrete 1994 workflows: call ahead, payphone, fax, paper forms.
