## **3.1 Structure & Tone**

Dual‑protagonist split: **Clara Winston** (survival, analogue) and **Avery Jordan** (procedural, FBI realism). Timelines interleave and converge in Chapter 4\. Themes: institutional systems vs the unknowable; cosmic intrusion; moral cost. Influences: The X‑Files, H.P. Lovecraft, Peter Clines, Annie Jacobsen.

## **3.2 Chapter List — Official Titles**

Use these exact titles in all builds, docs, and UI.

* **00 PROLOGUE: “DISORIENTATION”**  
   Clara escorts Reddy to Brightstar Daycare in liminal **New Kadath**; agency is subverted. Parallel: Avery’s 1989 training with Eddie Paldino and first case setup.

* **01 CHAPTER 1: “SIMPLE CURIOSITY”**  
   Clara fights and stealths out of Kids Kamp with Reddy. Avery travels to **Jackson, SC** to investigate Langston Gromley; arrests favored over kills.

* **02 CHAPTER 2: “PASSING INTEREST”**  
   Clara survives in the backwoods between Brightstar and reality; resource and noise management around Reddy. Avery’s clearance jumps to **Level X**; shadow counsel pushes lethal latitude.

* **03 CHAPTER 3: “INNOCENT FASCINATION”**  
   Reddy’s latent power surges; Clara collapses. Suspended Avery returns to Brightstar, is driven into **Unknown Kadath**, and reunites with Clara after time dilation.

   Antagonist focus: **Qin Xu Qi**. Player swaps between Clara and Avery; escort and rescue dynamics with Reddy across surreal spaces toward New York.
