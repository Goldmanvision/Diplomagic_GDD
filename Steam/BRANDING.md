# Steam Branding Guidelines â€” DIPLOMAGIC

## Visual Style
- **Era Reference**: 1994 aesthetic with VHS overlays, CRT scanlines, PS1 polygonal fidelity.
- **Palette**: muted greens, greys, and FBI beige with bursts of occult crimson.
- **Typography**: 90s sans-serif for UI; serif for in-world manuscripts.

## Logo
- Simple wordmark: DIPLOMAGIC in all caps, distressed texture.
- Secondary emblem: cult sigil overlay (to be designed).

## Key Art
- Clara and Avery back-to-back, with VHS distortion lines.
- Background: shattered seal suggesting cosmic intrusion.
- Use 4:3 safe areas; avoid edge cropping.

## Audio Branding
- Menu stingers: VHS eject sounds, dial tones, tape hiss.
- Trailer voiceover: deadpan procedural tone, no modern hype language.

## Storefront Consistency
- All assets (capsules, screenshots, trailer) must reflect period-accuracy.
- No anachronistic fonts or post-2000 iconography.
