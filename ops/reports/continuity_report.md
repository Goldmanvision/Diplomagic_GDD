# Scope
Aggregate narrative continuity across Prologue and Chapter 1 using current spawn tables and mirrors.

# Threads (current)
- Spectral Mystery — sightings and environmental effects.
- Cultist Cell — local occult activity, insignia, pamphlets.
- Mind‑Swap Incidents — civilians under anomalous control.
- Early Investigations — non‑combat beats connecting scenes.

# Scene IDs (provisional, pending Narrative)
- PRO-01 street-intro
- PRO-02 basement-search
- CH1-01 alley-sweep
- CH1-02 alley-followup
- CH1-03 warehouse-check

# Sources
- data/spawn/spawn_tables_prologue_ch1.md
- narrative/playbook.md
- narrative/outline_2025.md

# Findings
- Pacing caps hold with proposed bindings: Prologue ≤2 combats, Ch1 ≤3, spectral full ≤1 per chapter.
- Non‑combat beats must be codified per scene to prevent encounter stacking.
- Spectral gating requires clue threshold and darkness condition.

# Open items
- Finalize scene_id list from Narrative.
- Confirm spectral gating rule.
- Add per‑scene prop lists for 1994 compliance (Archivist).

# Next actions
1) Storymaster publishes scene_id list.  
2) Taxonomist adds scene_id column to spawn tables.  
3) QA sets telemetry for pacing.  
4) Archivist validates props by scene.
