## **Title**

**DIPLOMAGIC** — Investigative horror with dual protagonists and procedural realism (1994).

## **Executive Summary (≈300 words)**

Diplomagic is a single‑player investigative horror game set in 1994 America. Players alternate between FBI Special Agent **Avery Jordan** and civilian survivor **Clara Winston**. Their stories begin apart and converge mid‑campaign. The design blends procedural realism, period‑correct tools, and cosmic horror centered on the **Splinter of Azathoth**. Gameplay shifts between methodical evidence‑driven investigation, tense exploration, and tactical combat that punishes carelessness.

Avery’s chapters emphasize federal procedure, chain‑of‑custody, and coordinated operations using the FieldPad, TAPLINE, and MEDSTAT device UIs. Clara’s chapters emphasize survival, improvisation, and analog problem‑solving while protecting Reddy. The two perspectives expose the same conspiracy from different vectors, creating mechanical contrast and narrative friction.

Moment‑to‑moment play focuses on information gathering, risk assessment, and decisive execution. Systems support first‑person play with an optional over‑the‑shoulder toggle; Avery can use decoupled aiming for tactical positioning while Clara uses a more traditional feel. The world aesthetic mixes **PS1‑era 3D** fidelity with modern post‑processing and lighting to deliver dread without sacrificing readability.

The project targets **PC first**, with potential console ports **post‑launch**. It is built in **Unreal Engine 5.6**. A staged release plan calls for a **Halloween 2025 demo**, **Early Access in Q2 2026**, and **full release in Q1 2027**, resources permitting. **Mod tools** will be released in a supported beta **after Early Access**. Accessibility and localization are planned from the outset.

This GDD is structured for contractor and publisher use. Each section is self‑contained, versioned, and cross‑referenced. Narrative canon is maintained in the Narrative Playbook and linked where required. This section provides the concise product definition used by external stakeholders and anchors downstream scope decisions.
