# Tracker — CH6 Known Issues & Risks
Repo dir: /Trackers

## Risks
- Valve order clarity (A→B→C) unclear without Polaroids.  
- Blue-on-Blue false positives from pellet spread.  
- Night Gaunt light-stagger not obvious in bright areas.  
- Evidence cap UX when reaching 3/3 mid-interact.  
- Fuel/O2 edge cases if player returns to deep D‑LAMP post‑Annex.

## Mitigations
- Add valve tags and callouts.  
- Exclude friendly hitboxes from pellets at >10 m.  
- Flash an icon on successful light-stagger.  
- Show “Cap Reached” on interact; allow inspect without take.  
- Lock rover return after Annex breach begins.

## Test Focus
- Endings reliability; failover paths.  
- Ammo/tonic scarcity vs wave pacing.  
- Raid ROE messaging consistency.
