# Reviewer Questions — CH5–CH6 Root Merge
Repo dir: /Trackers

Narrative:
- Does the Annex route read cleanly without the ASCII map?
- Is the Clara/Betsy branch in CH5 sufficiently foreshadowed?

Systems:
- Are calm windows for Mana regen readable in combat?
- Is Blue‑on‑Blue too strict with shotgun spread after the exception?

World/UI:
- Are Valve A/B/C locations discoverable without frustration?
- Do prompts ever exceed 14 characters in edge contexts?

QA:
- Does the evidence cap block the 4th item reliably in Vault?
- Are Night Gaunt light‑stagger cues visible in bright areas?

Period/Compliance:
- Any StarTAC/modern tech leaks remain? Are MicroTAC references consistent?
- Deputy name ever overruns UI? If yes, elide surname.

Answer each with file/line refs or “N/A”.
