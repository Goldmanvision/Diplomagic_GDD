## Temp VO (with speaker tags)
[Eddie] Safety first. Voice before force.  
[Eddie] Challenge, then check those hands.  
[Eddie] Good. Now cuffs on.  
[Eddie] Search. Front pockets, then back.  
[Eddie] Photo, then bag, tag, and log. In that order.  
[Eddie] Locker window. Keep the chain tight.  
[Eddie] Range block. Eyes, sights, squeeze.  
[Eddie] Try dual‑wield. Control both muzzles.  
[Eddie] Decouple aim. Track target, hold line.  
[Eddie] Debrief at the board. Arrests always beat body counts.

## Subtitle rules
- Speaker tags required. Subtitles ON by default with size slider.
- No profanity. Keep lines ≤ 70 chars. One clause per line.

## Localization notes
- Prompts 3–12 chars ideal. Avoid slang/idioms in VO.
- Provide gloss for ROE and custody terms in SEC‑13 Glossary.
