# Epilogue Packaging

Add Epilogue patch and state tracker derived from canon. Implements ending branches driven by Final Score and Ch.5â€“6 choices. No new mechanics.

## Files
- `Patches/EPILOGUE.md`
- `Trackers/EPILOGUE-state.md`

## Notes
- Diegetic delivery via 1994 media surfaces.
- Mixed endings supported; NG+ and Meta variants gated by flags.
- Thresholds marked TBD for balance; safe defaults to be set in follow-up.

## Validation
- CI: chapter gating, exclusivity of GOOD/BAD flags, and montage consistency.
