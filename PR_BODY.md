# Chapter 2 Packaging

Adds CH2 patch and state tracker, aligned with the narrative outline.

## Files
- `Patches/CH2.md`
- `Trackers/CH2-state.md`

## Notes
- Clara: survival, stealth, and analog Rolodex rescue mechanic. Must keep Reddyâ€™s stat lines balanced for points.
- Avery: promoted with Level X clearance, meets Lewis Krill, tempted toward lethal methods. Player choice impacts alignment.
- Score thresholds remain TBD for balancing.
- 1994 tech fidelity enforced (Rolodex, payphone, fax, pager).
