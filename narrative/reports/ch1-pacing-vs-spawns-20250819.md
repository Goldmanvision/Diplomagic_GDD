## Gate Map additions — 2025-08-17

### G1 — Sources
- Playbook: `narrative/playbook.md#ch1-beats`  
- Outline: `narrative/outline_2025.md#chapter-1`

### G2 — Period checks
- See: `research/checks/period_check_core_terms_1994.md` and citations in `research/refs/refs_seed_1994.md`.

### G3 — Spec completeness
- Goals: establish clue loop, introduce countermeasure foreshadowing.  
- Beats: PRO → CH1‑01 setup → CH1‑02 escalation → CH1‑03 confrontation.  
- Assets: ADV‑0001/0002/0003/0004, alley/warehouse kits, clue pickups.  
- Risks: spectral cap regression, Deck readability at 800p.

### G4 — Branch coverage + failstates
- Branches: mainline, stealth, alarm‑trigger, talk‑down.  
- Failstates table resides in `data/spawn/spawn_tables_prologue_ch1.md`.

### G5 — UI strings and controls (subset)
- “Press E to Inspect”  
- “Hold Right Mouse to Focus”  
- “Spectral Countermeasure Ready”  
- Controls: WASD movement, Mouse look, E interact, Q countermeasure.

### Spectral Exposure tallies (SE)
| scene_id | seeds | reinforcements | SE sum | payoff type |
|----------|-------|----------------|--------|-------------|
| PRO-01   | 0     | 0              | 0.0    | none        |
| PRO-02   | 1     | 1 (0.5)        | 1.5    | none        |
| CH1-01   | 1     | 1 (0.5)        | 1.5    | minor tease |
| CH1-02   | 1     | 2 (1.0)        | 2.5    | minor payoff |
| CH1-03   | 1     | 3 (1.5)        | 4.0    | **major payoff** (spectral‑full) |

**Rules applied:** payoff occurs after first seed; ≤1 spectral‑full in Ch1.

### Seeds → Payoffs table
| seed scene_id | payoff scene_id | link/rationale |
|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| CH1-01 seed   | CH1-02 minor    | clue chain tees countermeasure |
| CH1-02 minor  | CH1-03 major    | warehouse darkness + threshold met |
