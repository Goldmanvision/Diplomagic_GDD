## CH2 — Avery: Inner Checkpoint

### Goal
Infiltrate the Jackson, SC compound, pass the inner gate challenge, detain a leader, and secure evidence without civilian harm.

### Setting
Barn/backlot compound outside Jackson, South Carolina. Night.

### Cast
Special Agent Avery Jordan; ASAC Franklin; SA Lewis Krill; Aiken Co. Deputy `{DeputyName}`; gate guard; “Deacon” analogue; civilians.

### 1994 Kit
SIG P226 or S&W 13; limited magazines; paper maps; Polaroid; payphone; fax; teletype. No weapon lights.

### Beats
1) **Briefing:** Franklin leads; Krill joins. Passphrase issued: “the stars are right tonight.” ROE emphasized.  
2) **Recon:** Guard rotations logged; civilians identified; inner gate protocol observed.  
3) **Approach:** Use cover or distraction; optional payphone call to SO for timing.  
4) **Inner Gate:** Respond with exact passphrase. One “Badge+Warrant” bluff retry permitted; second failure → `Alert=High`.  
5) **Search:** Outbuilding A (cash ledger, rosters), Shed B (generator), Office Shack (tapes, logbook).  
6) **Detain:** Non‑lethal takedown of Deacon analogue; secure .38.  
7) **Chain of Custody:** Bag+tag; complete FD‑302; fax to field office; send teletype BOLOs; coordinate bookings with `{DeputyName}`.  
8) **Exfil:** Save `F_GromleyCleared=1`. Hook to Clara: deputy mentions “trail behind the daycare.”

### Failure/Branches
- Wrong passphrase twice → Alert High; tougher patrols; lower score.  
- Civilian endangered → IA review flag; end‑chapter penalty.  
- Excessive force → score penalties and narrative censure.
