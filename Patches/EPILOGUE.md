# EPILOGUE Patch — DIPLOMAGIC

## Title
**Epilogue: Reorientation**

## Canon Summary
- Reddy defeats Elder splinters and reverts to normal size.
- Avery and Clara reunite, catching Reddy as he drifts down and embracing.
- Ending montage varies by Final Score and late-game choices (Ch.5–6).

## Ending Branches
### Clara’s Ending
- **Good**: Bestselling author, stable life.
- **Bad**: New cult leader.

### Avery’s Ending
- **Good**: Ambassador role; may offer Clara a clandestine job (if Clara Good).
- **Bad**: Cult enforcer; conflict with Clara if she’s Good, servitude if she’s Bad.

### New Game Plus Variants
- **Azathoth Dream**: Reddy revealed as Azathoth-in-dream-form; cosmic consumption route.
- **Meta**: Characters realize they are in a video game; desktop/console-specific exit behavior.

### False Ending Hooks (Global Rule)
Triggered on catastrophic failure states during or after Ch.6 (mission abort, chaos thresholds, or exit after warning).

## Beat Sheet (In-Game Flow)
1. **Post-Battle Descent** — Reddy shrinks; Clara and Avery catch him.
2. **Status Montage** — Quick vignettes keyed to moral path and Final Score.
3. **Branch Resolution** — Select and play Clara/Avery outcome scenes.
4. **Credits Bridge** — If NG+ unlocked, append stinger for Azathoth/Meta variants.
5. **Free Roam Unlock** — Optional post-game exploration reflecting the chosen ending.

## Cinematic Delivery (Diegetic Rule)
- End scenes play via period-accurate 1994 media surfaces when feasible (TV news, VHS playback, radio).
- No external camera angles; keep POV anchored.

## Implementation Notes
- Do not add new mechanics here; only narrative resolution and state tally.
- Respect prior flags (arrests vs kills, rescues, intel, Reddy care) in Final Score calculation.
- Ensure all voice lines follow character style: Clara warm/tactile; Avery terse/procedural.
