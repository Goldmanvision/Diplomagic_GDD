# CH7 pack — narrative + seeds

Prepare Chapter 7 helpers for root integration.

## Summary
- Add SEC‑03 CH7 narrative paste for NYC fallout and Krill illusions.
- Add Epilogue seeds file with routing flags and open hooks.
- Provide PR body for the CH7 pack.

## Constraints
- 1994 period: no smartphone/Wi‑Fi/Bluetooth/GPS/SMS.
- Prompts ≤14. Ambient phrase only: “the stars are right tonight.”
- City evidence cap = **2**; non‑lethal favored; friendly/civilian hits fail.

## Boss setup
- Krill acts as Hauser’s successor; Mindscape encounter seeded via anchor object and dual‑thread completion.

## Next
- Export world/UI merge, UI prompt extensions, and README/ToC bullets (Batch 2).
- Create feature branch `feat/ch7-pack` for root edits and open PR.

## Attachments (helpers on main)
- `Patches/ROOT_SEC-03_CH7_Narrative_Paste.md`
- `Patches/ROOT_Epilogue_Seeds_CH7.md`
