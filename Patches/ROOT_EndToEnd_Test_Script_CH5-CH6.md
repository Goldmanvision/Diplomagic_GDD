# End-to-End Test Script — CH5→CH6
Repo dir: /Patches

## Goal
Validate full flow: CH5 rogue pivot to CH6 raid endings. 1994 lock. Prompts ≤14. Ambient phrase only: “the stars are right tonight.”

## Setup
- New save; seed any. DeputyName via randomizer.  
- Difficulty: default. Ammo/tonic as tuning file.  
- Tools: stopwatch, notebook.

## Path 1 — Contain (Seal)
1) CH5: Hotel escape (no civilians harmed).  
2) WV island shaft → Deep D‑LAMP → Star Vampire → Rover.  
3) Iron Highway to Annex layby.  
4) CH6: Breaker loop → Valve Row tag A/B/C.  
5) Vault: Jam wards, turn A→B→C, lock gimbal.  
6) Extract to fence gap with {DeputyName}.  
7) Verify score: +5 ending, +2×EvidenceCount (≤3), no penalty.

## Path 2 — Sever (Escape)
Repeat 1–3. In Vault: plant 2 charges, interrupt chant, detonate, sprint. Verify +3 ending.

## Path 3 — Black File
Repeat 1–3. Photo pylon controls, photo gimbal plate, sample reagent. Exfil. Verify evidence max, rep −5.

## Must‑pass checks
- CH6 hostiles lethal; arrests absent.  
- Blue‑on‑Blue: any friendly hit → fail.  
- Prompts: none >14 chars.  
- SENTINEL unreachable in field; MicroTAC ok.  
- Evidence cap enforced at 3.

## Logs
