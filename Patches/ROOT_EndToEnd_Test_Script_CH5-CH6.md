# ROOT — End‑to‑End Test Script (CH5→CH6)
Repo dir: /Patches

**Goal:** Validate narrative flow, ROE, evidence cap, and endings.

## Path A — Contain
1) Start CH5 hotel. Escape with zero civilian harm.  
2) WV shaft → deep D‑LAMP → defeat Star Vampire → acquire rover + route card.  
3) Drive Iron Highway to SRS layby.  
4) Annex route: Bulkhead → Man‑Door → Passage (pull breaker) → Valve Row.  
5) **Contain:** Ward Jam → Valve **A→B→C** → confirm **STABLE**.  
6) Exfil fence gap. **Score:** +5 ending; +2 evidence each (cap 3). **Check:** BlueOnBlue=0.

## Path B — Sever
Repeat steps through Core. **Plant** ×2, interrupt chant, **Detonate**, sprint to egress. **Score:** +3.

## Path C — Black File
Collect **Photo×2** and **Sample×1** across Vault/Core. Exfil. **Score:** +5; **Rep −5**.

## Global Checks
- Prompts ≤14 (Ward Jam present).  
- Cameras only in Passage; breaker ≈90 s; K‑9 swap.  
- Evidence cap **3** enforced.  
- Lethal neutral; Blue‑on‑Blue fails.  
- Period‑correct tech only.  
- Ambient phrase appears only as ambient text.
