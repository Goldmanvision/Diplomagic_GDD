# SEC-03 — Narrative CH5–CH6 Merge (Entry Point)
Repo dir: /Patches

Use this file as the **entry point** when opening the PR. It references the split paste blocks (kept separate for clarity).

## Paste order
1) Replace `## CH5` with the contents of:
   - `/Patches/ROOT_SEC-03_CH5_Narrative_Paste.md`
2) Replace `## CH6` with the contents of:
   - `/Patches/ROOT_SEC-03_CH6_Narrative_Paste.md`

## Post‑paste checks
- CH6 states the raid ROE, lethal authorized, **Blue‑on‑Blue = fail**.
- Evidence cap **3** is present.
- 1994 lock maintained; **MicroTAC/pagers/payphones/Polaroids/analog CCTV** only.
- Ambient phrase appears only as ambient text: “the stars are right tonight.”
- Deputy name randomized.

## Note
We keep CH5 and CH6 as two paste files to reduce conflicts and ease review. This entry file exists to satisfy the PR body pointer.
