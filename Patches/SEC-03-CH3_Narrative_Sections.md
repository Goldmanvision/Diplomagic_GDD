# SEC-03 — CH3 Narrative Sections (Consolidated)

## CH3 — Clara & Reddy: “Innocent Fascination”
**Goal:** Survive Kadath, protect Reddy, repel scavengers without lethal force.  
**Setting:** Kadath forest near warped Brightstar (Jackson, SC). Time dilation persists.  
**Beats:**
1) Forage & trace a scavenger trail.  
2) Ambush springs; Clara shields Reddy.  
3) Swap to **Reddy Playable** telekinesis (infinite energy this chapter).  
4) Crowd control with non-lethal TK: pin, stack, block.  
5) Ethics check: wanton destruction reduces score.  
6) Clara collapses from concussion; Reddy powers down and returns to her side.  
7) Audio hook from Brightstar interior sets up convergence.

**Evidence:** Trail notes, delivery slips, ledger snapshots.  
**Phrase:** Ambient only: “the stars are right tonight.”  
**Failure/Retry:** Clara downed → Reddy rescue window; timer fail → soft reset; inventory persists.

## CH3 — Avery: “Suspension & Daycare Haunting”
**Goal:** Investigate condemned Brightstar while suspended; survive spectral threat; get forced into Kadath.  
**Setting:** Condemned Brightstar interior → Kadath threshold. Night.  
**Beats:**
1) Suspension notice from Franklin; fallout from Phillips.  
2) Solo return to condemned daycare.  
3) Spectral hunt; retrieve key evidence.  
4) Unwinnable fight; chase through threshold into Kadath.  
5) Rescue by Clara & Reddy; time-skew exchange.  
6) Save team-up flag for Chapter 4.

**Systems:** Spectral-Phased Muzzle Brake consumable enables limited damage; otherwise avoidance.  
**Evidence:** Condemnation copy, key ring, gate log fragment.  
**ROE:** Lethal allowed on spectral; civilian harm penalized.  
**Phrase:** Ambient only.
