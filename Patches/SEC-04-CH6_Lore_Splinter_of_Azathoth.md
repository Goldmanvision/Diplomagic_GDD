# SEC-04 — CH6 Lore: Splinter of Azathoth
Repo dir: /Patches

## Provenance (diegetic)
- **AEC relic** boxed during Cold War anomaly study; archived under D‑LAMP.  
- **DOE era:** custody drift; Order re‑discovers object in the 1980s.  
- **Cult doctrine:** splinter = “breath of the Sleeper”; chant carries line “the stars are right tonight.”

## Physical
- Obelisk shard in suspension gimbal; emits low‑band hum; distorts geometry at surge.

## Effects
- **Spatial fold:** corridors loop; doors re‑map.  
- **Perceptual drift:** time stamps desync; Polaroid confirms truth.  
- **Biological:** necrotic urge (zombies), predatory flock (night gaunts).

## Handling
- No direct touch; use pole clamps.  
- Shield/Valve cycle stabilizes; charges sever link; photos/samples feed Black File.

## Evidence hooks (1994)
- Typed memos, stamped crates, logbook notations; Polaroid plates of gimbal.

## Redactions
- Never quote chants beyond ambient phrase. No modern tech references.
