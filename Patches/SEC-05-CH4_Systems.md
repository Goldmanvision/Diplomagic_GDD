# SEC-05 — CH4 Systems (Revised)

## Reddy TK in CH4
- **Burst (1x):** Consumed at chapter start to kill the Beast. No score penalty.  
- **Shield (1x):** One-time damage mitigation during traverse or skirmish.  
- **Jam Ward (0–1x):** Single-use interference with a warded device or symbol if encountered (optional).

## FieldPad / TAPLINE / SENTINEL
- **Status:** `Offline`. No network or satellite link.  
- **Storage:** Evidence stored to local device memory with timestamps.  
- **Sync:** Disabled. No external comms or internet.

## Walled City Perimeter
- **AI:** Outskirt hostiles operate in small packs; avoid direct firefights.  
- **Gate Logic:** Wardens respond to noise and approach posture. Entry deferred to next chapter’s parley.  
- **Signals:** Horn-call escalations mark patrol changes.

## Scoring Hooks
+3 evidence page; +2 camp without alert; +3 non-lethal disable on humanoids; −3 civilian harm; −2 Alert High end.  
**Neutral:** lethal against **non-human** monstrous threats (e.g., the entry Beast).
