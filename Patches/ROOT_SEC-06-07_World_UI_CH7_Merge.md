# ROOT_SEC-06-07_World_UI_CH7_Merge.md
> Append to SEC-06 (World) and SEC-07 (UI). Period: 1994. City evidence cap **2**. Non-lethal favored. Friendly/civilian hits = fail.

## SEC-06 — City World Merge
- Public spaces allow Photo/Sample with consent. Private interiors require consent or warrant text; avoid unlawful evidence.
- Evidence cap **2** across city segments; deny third pickup with “Evidence full.”
- Nodes: Payphone taps, safehouse stakeouts, precinct handoffs, artifact/sigil anchor search.
- Illusions: doubled NPC silhouettes, desynced audio, false signage. FieldPad vs MEDSTAT comparisons reveal fakes.
- Mindscape access: locate **anchor** object; entry via ritual phrase set; exit by **Wake** or **Ground** interaction.
- Civilians: erratic paths; panic escalates patrol density and affects Epilogue scoring.

## SEC-06 — Interactables
- Payphone: Dial, Hang Up, Trace (scripted).
- Pager: Page, Read.
- Fax: Fax Send (use in precincts).
- Escort routes: start/stop nodes; crowd control without lethal force.
- Anchor/Sigil: Inspect, Anchor, Counter.

## SEC-07 — UI Merge
- HUD: `Evidence 0/2` during investigation. Hide counter elsewhere.
- Failure: any friendly/civilian hit = immediate fail in city scenes.
- Illusion tells: brief **Reveal** banner when contradictions detected.
- Keep prompts ≤14 and 1994-authentic.
