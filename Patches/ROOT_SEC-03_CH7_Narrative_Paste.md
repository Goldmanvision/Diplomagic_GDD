# [SEC-03] Chapter 7 — Aftermath & Apparitions (Narrative Paste)

> Sources: Narrative Playbook • Outline 2025. Period: 1994. Ambient phrase only: “the stars are right tonight.”

## Scope
- Locale: New York City and nearby boroughs after SRS fallout.
- Frame on Avery for the Franklin murder is lifted; public trust remains low.
- Antagonist: **Krill** (Hauser’s successor). Modus: mind control, illusions, psychic bleed.
- Encounter arc: street-level investigations → mind-hazards → **Mindscape** confrontation hook.
- City evidence cap = **2**. Non‑lethal favored. Friendly/civilian hits = **fail**.

## Systems Constraints
- 1994 authenticity: landlines, pagers, fax, payphones, film, Polaroid. No smartphone/Wi‑Fi/Bluetooth/GPS/SMS.
- FieldPad/MEDSTAT: cable sync or SENTINEL link only.
- Spells: **Phrases equip L/R**, **Scrolls single‑use**, **Mana calm‑regen**.
- Deputy identity randomized per session. Use `<DEPUTY_NAME>` token in text.
- Only ambient phrase allowed globally: “the stars are right tonight.”

## Avery Thread
- Goal: unwind remaining cover‑up, locate Krill’s control nodes, clear public narrative without breaking FBI rules.
- Play: surveillance on payphones and safehouses; interviews with mind‑swapped civilians; forensic drops at precincts.
- Mechanics:
  - **Non‑lethal priority**: tasers/batons; firearm discharge near civilians triggers fail.
  - **Evidence cap 2**: city HUD shows `Evidence 0/2` during Avery segments.
  - **Illusion checks**: compare FieldPad sensor drift vs. MEDSTAT samples to expose false cues.

## Clara Thread
- Goal: protect witnesses targeted by Krill’s proxies; gather ritual counter‑phrases; trace EM anomalies.
- Play: escort routes, decoy tactics, controlled reveals of **Reddy** to startle cult footmen.
- Mechanics:
  - **Calm‑regen** pacing; scroll scarcity; phrase loadout puzzle for **Mindscape** entry.
  - Cameras limited to public spaces; consent needed for photo evidence in private interiors.

## Mindscape Hook (Boss Setup)
- Trigger: complete both protagonists’ node objectives; locate Krill’s anchor object (artifact or sigil series).
- Environment: fractured NYC landmarks; visual glitches, doubled NPCs; sound desync.
- Boss: **Krill** deploys illusions that copy friendly silhouettes to bait Blue‑on‑Blue; city rules still apply.
- Outcome: defeat forces Krill to retreat; leaves a **Krill_Remnant** flag for Epilogue routing.

## Fail/State Rules
- Any friendly/civilian hit = immediate fail in city scenes.
- Evidence beyond 2 is denied with “Evidence full.”
- Public panic escalations persist into Epilogue scoring if siren thresholds are exceeded.

## Deliverables in SEC‑03
- Replace CH7 narrative section with this paste.
- Preserve anchors used by SEC‑06/07 for UI and world references.
