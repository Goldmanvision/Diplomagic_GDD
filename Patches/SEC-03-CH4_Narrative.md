# SEC-03 — CH4 Narrative (Revised)

## Title
Toward the Walled City

## Goal
Escape Kadath by reaching the Walled City; secure temporary refuge.

## Setting
Kadath forest near Brightstar’s Pine Break → hostile outskirts → South Gate of the Walled City (Kadath of Nyarlathotep inspiration). Night-dusk cycle.

## Cast
Clara Winston; Reddy; SA Avery Jordan; Outskirt Scavengers; Wall Wardens; slain Beast (on entry).

## Beats
1) **Pine Break kill:** Beast chases Avery. Reddy unleashes one telekinetic **Burst** and kills it.  
2) **Meet & align:** Clara, Reddy, Avery align. Clara confirms days of failed exit attempts via Brightstar and Pine Break.  
3) **Systems down:** Avery’s FieldPad and **TAPLINE** cannot connect to **SENTINEL**; devices run **offline** and store evidence locally only.  
4) **Recon ridge:** City spotted with binoculars. Decision to approach despite hostile outskirts.  
5) **Prep & pack:** Water safe, food packed, safe nest marked.  
6) **Traverse outskirts:** Stealth through hostile territory; optional barter. Whispered phrase present as ambient only.  
7) **Skirmish to ditch:** Brief chase; reach cover within bowshot of the South Gate.  
8) **Gate standoff:** Wardens watch; horn-call. No entry yet. Camp outside. Plan parley next.

## Failure/Branches
- Alert escalates during traverse → bigger skirmish and lower end score.  
- Injury without camp → fatigue penalties at start of next chapter.

## Evidence Log
Gate silhouettes, horn-call pattern, wall measurements, scavenger signs, SENTINEL/TAPLINE offline notes.
