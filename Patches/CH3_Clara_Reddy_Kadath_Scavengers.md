# Patch: CH3 — Clara & Reddy “Innocent Fascination” (Kadath Survival + Scavengers)
Version: v0.1 • 2025-08-15
Owner: Nick Goldman

## Summary
Clara is ambushed by Kadath scavengers during a supply run. Reddy becomes playable with telekinesis and infinite mana. Non‑lethal telekinetic play is rewarded; wanton destruction is penalized. Chapter ends with Clara collapsing as Reddy powers down.

## Setting
Kadath wilderness near warped Brightstar Daycare (Jackson, SC continuity). Time dilation persists.

## Beats
1) **Forage & Trace:** Clara scouts a scavenger trail.  
2) **Ambush:** Scavengers spring a trap. Clara protects Reddy.  
3) **Reddy Playable:** Swap. Hover‑tank locomotion. Grab/Throw physics objects and enemies. Infinite TK energy.  
4) **Crowd Control:** Non‑lethal options: pin, stack, block doorways, toss into soft surfaces.  
5) **Ethics Check:** Wanton destruction (explosives, crushing piles) reduces score.  
6) **Fade:** Clara suffers concussion collapse. Reddy drifts down, powers fade, returns to Clara’s side.  
7) **Hook:** Audio stinger from Brightstar interior. Lead to Avery arc.

## Systems
- **Reddy Telekinesis v1:** Pick up enemy or object; primary = launch; secondary = hold/position; release = drop.  
- **Scoring:** +Non‑lethal disables and protective plays; −wanton TK destruction.  
- **Time Dilation:** Environment continues to loop; stash points remain valid.  
- **Phrase:** Background whisper of “the stars are right tonight.” Never spoken by Clara or Reddy.

## Failure/Retry
Clara downed → swap to Reddy rescue window. Reddy timer expires → soft reset to pre‑ambush.

## 1994 Lock
No modern tech. Keep period props already established.
