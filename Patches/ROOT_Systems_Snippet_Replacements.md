# ROOT — Systems Snippet Replacements (SEC-05)
Repo dir: /Patches

Paste each block under the matching heading in `SEC-05-SYSTEMS - Systems & Mechanics.md`.

---
## Spellcasting Overview — INSERT
**Phrases** are multi‑use spells stored on FieldPad/MEDSTAT. Equip to **Left/Right** and cast with **Cast L/R**. **Scrolls** are single‑use items in Inventory. **Mana** regenerates only during calm windows. Prompts ≤14: *Equip L, Equip R, Cast L, Cast R, Ward Jam, Shield*.

Ambient phrase remains ambient: “the stars are right tonight.”

---
## Field Devices — INSERT
**FieldPad/MEDSTAT** cache only in the field. No network. **SENTINEL** access occurs at fixed terminals (NYFO, secured nodes). Photos use Polaroids. Evidence items track to a chapter‑scoped counter.

1994 lock: MicroTAC, pagers, payphones, Polaroids, analog CCTV.

---
## Combat Rules — INSERT
**CH6 is a raid. Lethal authorized.** Neutralizations are score‑neutral. **Blue‑on‑Blue = hard fail (−10)**.
Exceptions:
- Damage fully absorbed by **Shield** does not fail the chapter.
- A single stray shotgun pellet at >10 m does not fail.

Urban scenes (CH5 hotel, CH7 city): non‑lethal favored; any civilian/agent harm fails.

---
## Stealth & Surveillance — INSERT
Cameras appear **only** in Service Passage. **Breaker pull ≈90 s** powers a loop that drops cams and swaps K‑9 routes. No CCTV in the Vault. Use prompts: *Hide, Crouch, Breach, Lights*.

---
## Endings & Outcomes — INSERT
**Contain (Seal):** Jam wards (**Ward Jam**), set gimbal **STABLE**, open valves **A→B→C**. Score **+5**.  
**Sever (Escape):** **Plant×2**, interrupt chant, **Detonate**, sprint to egress. Score **+3**.  
**Black File:** **Photo×2** + **Sample×1**, exfiltrate. Score **+5**, Reputation **−5**.

**Evidence cap in CH6 = 3 total**. Attempts beyond the cap do not score.

---
## Tuning & Balancing — INSERT
Spawn pacing targets: 15–20 s trickle; 60–90 s surge near Core. If **Ammo <25%** entering Vault, reduce next spawn chance by 20%. Fear spikes should not overlap Valve interactions. Mana calm‑regen windows follow fight lulls.

---
## Failure States — INSERT
- **Blue‑on‑Blue** set → immediate chapter fail (apply −10; abort).  
- Exfil timeout on Sever if detonation too late.  
- Evidence over‑cap ignored; do not penalize.  
- Mind‑controlled ally hits count as Blue‑on‑Blue (CH7).

Prompts remain ≤14; deputy name randomized; ambient phrase rule applies.
