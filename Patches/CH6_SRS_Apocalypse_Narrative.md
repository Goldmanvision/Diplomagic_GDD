# Patch: CH6 — “Savannah River: Containment”
Version: v0.1 • 2025-08-15
Owner: Nick Goldman
Repo dir: /Patches

## Summary
Final chapter. A sanctioned **raid** against hostile combatants tied to the Sovereign Nation of New Kadath / Order of the Splintered God. Avery leads UC ingress but ROE is lethal. Clara and Reddy support. D‑LAMP ties confirm procurement of ritual components. The op spirals into an apocalyptic containment event at SRS. Tone: no clean win.

## Goals
- Execute UC at SRS-adjacent safehouse and roll up the cell.
- Track the ritual chain into SRS perimeter.
- Survive the containment event. Extract with evidence.

## Setting
Augusta/Jackson corridor → SRS perimeter and industrial interiors (1994 security: chain-link, K‑9s, badge checks, paper logs). Night.

## Cast
SA Avery Jordan; Clara Winston; Reddy; Aiken Co. Deputy {DeputyName}; cult cell lead; SRS security; D‑LAMP liaison (off-screen).

## Beats
1) **UC Pre‑brief:** Final packet review (D‑LAMP POs, phone intersections). Equip phrases L/R; scrolls in inventory.  
2) **Safehouse Sting:** Buy/bust with {DeputyName}. Seize ledgers, reagents, maps of SRS service tunnels.  
3) **Perimeter Breach:** Follow hot lead to SRS fence. Paper badge spoof + cover story. Stealth route if cover fails.  
4) **Core Galleries:** Evidence of ritual prep near decommissioned piping. Ambient chant with the phrase “the stars are right tonight.”  
5) **Ritual Ignition:** Cell triggers eldritch event. Space folds; alarms fail. Reddy’s **Shield** becomes essential.  
6) **Containment Choice:**  
   - **Seal** the breach (high cost, heavy casualties averted).  
   - **Sever** the link (party escapes; region suffers anomalies).  
   - **Silence** witnesses (dark choice; highest evidence preserved, worst moral outcome).  
7) **Extraction:** Whichever path, evacuation under sirens and horn‑like wails. Save flags for Epilogue scoring.

## End States
- **Pyrrhic Contain:** Site saved, team scarred.  
- **Escape With Stain:** Team survives, area warped.  
- **Black File:** Evidence intact, reputation ruined.

## Evidence
Seized ledgers, reagent manifests, SRS maps, photos of ritual apparatus (Polaroid refs), custody chain forms, UC ops order with after‑action.

## 1994 Lock
SIG P226/S&W 13; flashlights only; paper badges; radios; faxes at SO. No networked comms on site.
