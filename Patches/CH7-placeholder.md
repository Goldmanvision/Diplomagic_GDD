# CH7 Placeholder Patch â€” DIPLOMAGIC

## Title
**CH7: Systems Fallout (Packaging Only)**

## Purpose
This chapter does not exist in the Narrative Playbook or Outline. It is a packaging-only placeholder.

## Function
- Provides linkage between CH6 (`Glorious Quest`) and Epilogue (`Reorientation`).
- Ensures build continuity for mission flow and FINAL SCORE tally.
- No new missions, NPCs, or states defined.

## Notes
- All Epilogue triggers depend on CH6 completion flags.
- This patch should not be expanded without explicit narrative approval.
