# PR: CH5–CH6 Root Merge (Narrative/Systems/World/UI)

## Summary
Integrates CH5–CH6 across root docs. CH6 reframed as a raid with lethal ROE and Blue-on-Blue fail; evidence cap 3; prompts ≤14; 1994 period. Ambient phrase retained: “the stars are right tonight.”

## Changes
- Replaced CH5 and CH6 in SEC-03
- Appended systems blocks (phrases/scrolls, ROE, cameras, endings, tuning, failure)
- Added world nodes and UI prompts/flows; referenced ASCII map
- Updated README/ToC inserts (optional)

## Checks
- [ ] 1994 audit passes (MicroTAC only; no Wi‑Fi/Bluetooth/GPS/SMS)
- [ ] Prompts ≤14 chars (see `/Patches/ROOT_SEC-07_UI_Prompts_Master.md`)
- [ ] Ambient phrase is ambient-only
- [ ] CH6 ROE: lethal authorized; Blue-on-Blue = fail
- [ ] Evidence cap 3 enforced
- [ ] Crosslinks validated (see link checklist)
