# ROOT — Timeline Continuity (CH4→CH6)
Repo dir: /Patches

1994 period; ambient phrase only: “the stars are right tonight.”

## Key beats by day (relative)
**D‑2 (late):** CH4 boss in Kadath City. American Cultist defeated. Ancient spellbook found. Fast Travel phrase unlocked; other phrases optional.  
**D‑1:** Avery/Clara/Reddy exit via Fast Travel to Avery’s car. No wide comms; FieldPad caches locally.  
**D0 (morning):** NY hotel near NYFO. Avery debrief. Krill raises clearance outside room.  
**D0 (night):** Fred Franklin murdered.  
**D+1 (early):** Agents attempt to detain Avery; stealth or non‑lethal takedowns. `F_EscapeHotel=1`. Rogue posture begins.  
**D+1 (day):** WV island elevator → one‑mile descent to deep D‑LAMP. `F_DLampUnderground=1`.  
**D+1 (evening):** Star Vampire mini‑boss cleared in Pump Cavern; rover acquired. Iron Highway drive. Layby at SRS bulkhead.  
**D+1 (night):** CH6 Annex breach → Service Passage → Valve Row → Core → Splinter Vault. Endings: Contain / Sever / Black File. Extract to fence gap.  
**D+2:** Return toward NYFO (or safe node) for uploads via SENTINEL terminals only.

## Continuity constraints
- MicroTAC only; pagers + payphones. No internet in field.  
- Phrases equip L/R; scrolls single‑use; Mana regen only in calm windows.  
- CH6: lethal authorized; Blue‑on‑Blue fail; evidence cap 3.  
- Deputy name randomized per save; surname may elide in UI.

## Cross‑checks
- CH4 spellbook present before CH5.  
- CH5 rogue posture active before deep D‑LAMP.  
- CH6 no civilians by design.
