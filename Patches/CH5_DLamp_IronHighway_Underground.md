# Patch: CH5 — “Iron Highway: One Mile Down” (Addendum)
Version: v0.4 • 2025-08-15
Owner: Nick Goldman
Repo dir: /Patches

## Summary
D‑LAMP and its Iron Highway sit **one mile underground**. Avery accesses the D‑LAMP elevator via a **river island in West Virginia** using a concealed shaft. Inside the abandoned D‑LAMP complex he finds a **D‑LAMP‑branded utility vehicle** and drives the **Iron Highway** toward a **sealed SRS sub‑facility** that houses the **Splinter of Azathoth**. The abandoned site proves cult occupation from the 1980s onward.

## Beats (insert into CH5 finale, before SRS fence)
1) **Island Shaft (WV):** Locate concealed elevator kiosk on a river island. Acquire access key (puzzle or found badge). Descend **~1 mile** to D‑LAMP.  
2) **Abandoned D‑LAMP:** Dark galleries. Evidence of **AEC‑era** exit and later DOE neglect. Signs of **The Order of the Splintered God** occupation (1980s→1990s).  
3) **Undead Awakening:** First encounters with **zombies** and **night gaunts**. Ambient liturgy with “the stars are right tonight.”  
4) **Mini‑Boss — Star Vampire:** Arena encounter in a pump cavern. Beat it to reach the vehicle bay.  
5) **Vehicle Bay:** Secure **D‑LAMP Utility Rover**.  
6) **Iron Highway Drive:** Navigate maintenance tunnels, avoid collapses, pass signage toward **SRS Secret Annex**.  
7) **SRS Seal:** Arrive at security bulkhead to SRS **Splinter Vault**. Chapter end near breach point; roll into CH6.

## Evidence (1994‑safe)
- AEC/DOE handover memo, 1970s (copy).  
- 1980s ledger fragments showing occupancy and ritual purchases.  
- Worship ephemera: sigils, rota schedules, phone slips.  
- Vehicle checkout log (D‑LAMP) and Iron Highway route cards.
