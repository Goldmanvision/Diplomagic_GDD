## CH2 — Clara: Kadath Survival

### Goal
Survive, feed Reddy, attempt escape, alert parents to collect children.

### Setting
Kadath forest beyond “Pine Break” portal behind Brightstar. Brightstar interior is liminal and scrambled except anchors.

### Cast
Clara Winston; Reddy; wardens; staff; distant children.

### 1994 Kit
Maglite, Polaroid, twine, chalk, matches, microcassette recorder, paper map, canteen, iodine, first-aid. MEDSTAT note-card (text only; intermittent SENTINEL).

### Beats
1) **Bivouac:** Learn portal at Pine Break. Forage. Set chalk mark.  
2) **Water run:** Culvert found. Boil or iodine → `WaterSafe`.  
3) **Loop demo:** Trails A–D loop. Chalk fades past 30 m from Brightstar.  
4) **Stash Reddy:** Use nearest Safe Nest (Bivouac/Bus/Locker). Carry = +noise, −stealth.  
5) **Infiltration I — Kitchen:** Food, can opener, canteen → `FoodSecured`.  
6) **Infiltration II — Nurse:** Iodine, gauze, D-cells; unlock Nurse Locker Safe Nest.  
7) **Office break-in:** Emergency Contact ledger + attendance log. Transcribe to MEDSTAT.  
8) **Parent calls:** Use landline. Call Intercept meter visible while connected; hang up to avoid intercept.  
9) **Brightstar Brawl (mandatory):** Multipurpose room fight. Non-lethal favored. Loot Master Keys, Admin map, Medkit → `F_BrawlWon=1`, `F_MasterKeys=1`.  
10) **Admin sweep:** Roster, delivery slips. Record vent whisper “the stars are right tonight.” Playback opens one warded cabinet.  
11) **Backtrack:** Return via portal. Feed Reddy. Manage meters.  
12) **Exit test:** Even with `FoodSecured & WaterSafe & ParentsConfirmed≥NMin`, outer trail collapses. Chapter wall holds.

### Failure/Branches
- Cry ping while carrying Reddy draws sweep.  
- Intercept at 100 cancels call and raises Alert.  
- Brawl defeat or Reddy harmed → soft reset to pre-call checkpoint; inventory kept; +Alert on retry.

### Evidence Log (text only)
Emergency ledger pages, attendance, roster, delivery slips, phrase notes, loop map, breaker/anchor notes.

### Scoring
See Patch file. Non-lethal and SafeCall bonuses prioritized.
