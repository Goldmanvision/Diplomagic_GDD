# [SEC-03] Chapter 6 — Glorious Quest (Narrative Paste)

> Source of truth: Narrative Playbook • Outline 2025. Period: 1994. Ambient phrase only: “the stars are right tonight.”

## Scope
- Dual path operation against **Richard Tack** culminating at the **Savannah River Site (SRS)** with interlocks to **D‑LAMP (WV)**.
- Player alternates between locations via open‑world travel unlocked in CH5.
- New enemy type: **Mystical Heads**; spawn in distorted reactor chambers.

## Core Objective
Disable the **Transdimensional Complex Device** before Tack triggers cross‑dimensional brainwashing; overload leads to timed escape through collapsing, reality‑warped corridors.

## Path Structure
- **Clara — Stealth/Infiltration**
  - Goals: disable security systems, avoid detection by cultists and possessed security personnel.
  - Tools: ward jamming, valves, plant/detonate charges, photo/sample evidence.
- **Avery — Assault/Fireteam**
  - Goals: clear hostile forces, disable protective wards, cover Clara’s objectives.
  - Tools: cast/equip phrases, breaching, K‑9 reroute triggers, valve operations.

## Raid Rules (live in helpers)
- **CH6 = raid. Lethal authorized.** Neutralizations are **score‑neutral**.
- **Blue‑on‑Blue = hard fail (−10).** Exceptions:
  - **Shield‑absorbed** friendly hit.
  - A **single shotgun pellet** striking a friendly from **>10 m**.
- **Evidence cap in CH6 = 3 total.** HUD must show `Evidence 0/3` and `BlueOnBlue` flag.
- **Cameras only** in **Service Passage**. **No CCTV in Vault**.
- **Breaker ≈90 s** to cycle after trip. **K‑9 reroute** available via handler diversion or scent decoy.

## 1994 Constraints
- No smartphone/Wi‑Fi/Bluetooth/GPS/SMS. Navigation via printed maps, posted site diagrams, radio freqs.
- Comms over analog radios; logging on paper, Polaroids, and film camera; lab hand‑offs by courier.

## Spell/Item System
- **Phrases equip L/R**; **Scrolls single‑use**; **Mana calm‑regen**.
- Only ambient phrase in VO/text: “the stars are right tonight.”
- Deputy name randomized per session. Use `<DEPUTY_NAME>` placeholder where referenced.

## Evidence & Cameras
- Max three pieces of evidence total in CH6. Choice tension: tactical vs investigative.
- Photographic evidence is permitted in **Service Passage** where cameras exist.
- No photography in Vault due to zero CCTV and radiation protocols; rely on samples/logs.

## Deliverables in SEC‑03
- Replace CH6 narrative with this paste.
- Ensure cross‑refs to SEC‑05/06/07 remain intact.
