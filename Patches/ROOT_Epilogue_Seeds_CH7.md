# ROOT_Epilogue_Seeds_CH7.md

> Seeds set by Chapter 7 outcomes. Period: 1994. Ambient phrase only: “the stars are right tonight.”

Track these flags for Epilogue routing:

- `FBI_Rejoin` — Avery adheres to ROE in city, zero civilian hits, submits evidence chain by fax/pager coordination; public panic low.
- `Ambassador` — Clara mediates with international contact; `Intl_Cell` exposed without casualties; media narrative balanced.
- `Rogue` — Multiple off‑book actions, evidence not logged; panic medium; allies distance themselves.
- `Join_Cult` — Player equips forbidden phrases and spares cult lieutenants; `Krill_Remnant` true; accepts invite.
- `Insanity` — Mindscape exposure > threshold; repeated illusion fails; hallucination residues noted by MEDSTAT.
- `Dismissed` — Any friendly/civilian hit in city or repeated ROE violations; employment terminated.

Open hooks to preserve into Epilogue content:
- `Krill_Remnant` — Boss retreats; lingering influence produces post‑credits risk.
- `Intl_Cell` — Foreign network remains active; embassy angle unresolved.
- `D-LAMP_Elsewhere` — Device activity detected outside SRS/WV.
- `Media_Leak` — Reporter receives partial docs; may flip narrative if handled.
- `Custody_Case` — Personal legal thread remains open; affects tone of endings.

HUD note for city: display `Evidence 0/2` when evidence mode is active; hide outside investigation moments.
