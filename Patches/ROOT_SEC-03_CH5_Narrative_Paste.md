# [SEC-03] Chapter 5 — Renewed Purpose (Narrative Paste)

> Source of truth: Narrative Playbook • Outline 2025. Period: 1994. No smartphone/Wi‑Fi/Bluetooth/GPS/SMS. Ambient phrase only: “the stars are right tonight.”

## Scope
- Protagonists: Avery (primary), Clara (secondary thread).
- Setting: New York City and surrounding tri‑state travel hub. Avery’s car acts as a mobile base.
- Structure: Open‑world hub unlock + parallel Clara beat.

## Avery Beats
- Returns to NYC with Clara and Reddy; learns Fred Franklin has been murdered and is framed as a suspect.
- Chooses to operate off‑book while clearing his name. Contacts use landlines, pagers, fax. Evidence is walked to drop sites.
- World opens with **Federally Seized** variants of past locations. New enemy mixes appear only in seized sites.
- Day/Night cycle alters spawns and civilians:
  - Day: mind‑swapped civilians in public spaces; crowd‑control favored. Friendly hits fail states.
  - Night: ghosts and abominations increase; patrol density reduced.
- Vehicle loop: plan at trunk loadout, drive to site, park legally or risk tow, approach on foot. No GPS; rely on printed maps and signage.

## Clara Beats
- Tracks Betsy Lumbar and confirms allegiance to **Qin Xu Qi**.
- Boss branch:
  - If player found **Cultist Literature** in Prologue: Suzanne Cutlass intercepts; arrest sequence replaces fight.
  - Else: Betsy transforms into a **wendigo**; combat boss with environmental hazards.

## Systems Hooks
- FieldPad/MEDSTAT are cable‑synced or SENTINEL‑linked only; no internet.
- Spells: **Phrases equip L/R**, **Scrolls single‑use**, **Mana calm‑regen** (no combat regen spike).
- Deputy name must be randomized per session. Use placeholder `<DEPUTY_NAME>` in text.
- Only ambient phrase permitted globally: “the stars are right tonight.”

## Fail/State Rules
- City friendly/civilian hits = fail.
- Maintain 1994 authenticity in UI prompts, signage, and comms.
- Persist clues that set up Chapter 6 objectives without revealing SRS details.

## Deliverables in SEC‑03
- Replace CH5 narrative with this paste.
- Preserve anchors used by SEC‑05/06/07 cross‑refs.
