# Patch: CH3 — Avery “Suspension & Daycare Haunting”
Version: v0.1 • 2025-08-15
Owner: Nick Goldman

## Summary
Avery is suspended after the Walter Phillips shooting. He returns to the condemned Brightstar Daycare (Jackson, SC continuity), encounters spectral enemies, is chased into Unknown Kadath, and is rescued by Clara and Reddy. Team‑up begins in Chapter 4.

## Beats
1) **Suspension Notice:** Franklin informs Avery. Phillips link fallout.  
2) **Solo Return:** Avery enters condemned Brightstar after hours.  
3) **Spectral Hunt:** Avoid prowling phantom; retrieve key evidence.  
4) **No Win Fight:** Massive beast forces a chase out through Kadath threshold.  
5) **Rescue:** Clara and Reddy find Avery in the wasteland; time‑skew exchange.  
6) **Chapter Hand‑off:** Save team‑up flag for Ch.4 start.

## Systems
- **Spectral Threat:** Cannot be killed by normal ammo.  
- **Spectral‑Phased Muzzle Brake:** Limited pickups enable temporary damage to ghost cultists.  
- **Stealth Window:** Minimal. Inventory management between set pieces only.  
- **ROE/Scoring:** Lethal on transdimensional hostiles allowed; still penalize civilian endangerment.

## Evidence
Condemnation report copy, daycare key ring, gate log fragment linked to phone calls.

## 1994 Lock
Sidearm SIG P226 or S&W 13; paper maps; payphone; fax/teletype later. No weapon lights.
