### Inner checkpoint passphrase
Challenge requires exact match: "the stars are right tonight."  
Logic: if input equals phrase then Clearance else Alert increments. One retry via Badge plus Warrant bluff. Failure sets Alert High.

### Rules of engagement
Non-lethal arrests score higher. Lethal or unjustified force applies penalties. Exception: if an NPC initiates lethal force then any player lethal response in that encounter is score neutral.

### Evidence chain
Bag and tag items. Complete FD-302. Fax to field office. Teletype BOLOs.  
Vars: EvidenceCount, FD302Filed, TeletypeSent.

### Scoring
+5 Arrest. +3 Evidence Bagged. +2 FD-302. +2 Teletype.  
-5 Lethal. -3 Civilian Endangered. -2 Alert High end.  
Exception: NPC-initiated lethal force is score neutral. No bonus. No penalty.

### Shared alert hook
If Avery CH2 ends Alert High then Clara CH2 Call Intercept base window shortens.
